This data helps us remember your preferences and provide you with a personalized experience.<br><br><strong>3.1. What is Local Storage?</strong><br>Local Storage is a feature of modern web browsers that allows data to be stored locally on your device. Unlike cookies, Local Storage can store larger amounts of data, and the data remains available even after the browser is closed until it is explicitly deleted.<br><br><strong>3.2. Use of Local Storage on our Website</strong><br>We use Local Storage exclusively for the following purposes:<ul><li><strong>Storing your chosen theme:</strong> So that the design you prefer (e.g., light or dark mode) is automatically applied on your next visit.</li><li><strong>Storing your preferred language:</strong> So that the user interface is displayed in your chosen language.</li></ul><br><strong>3.3. Use of Google Analytics</strong><br>We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”), to collect anonymized information about the use of our website. For example, page views along with the date are recorded and aggregated (e.g., on 02/02/2025, the page was viewed by 5 users). The collected data is used solely for analysis and optimization of our website and is not combined with data from other sources.<br><br><strong>3.4. Granular Data Collection (Google Signals)</strong><br>In addition to the standard data collection, Google Analytics offers the option, via Google Signals, to collect more detailed information. This includes, for example:<ul><li>Precise location information (e.g., city and region – without the full address)</li><li>Device details, such as brand, model, and operating system version</li><li>Browser information, such as the version (without the full user agent string)</li><li>Screen resolution</li></ul>This additional data enables enhanced features, such as targeted remarketing and more detailed analysis. If you do not wish to have this detailed data collection, you can disable this option in your privacy settings. The additional data is used solely for analytical purposes."
